REFUND POLICY
Effective Date: June 1, 2025
S.S. Enterprises, with its registered office at 101/2, Sector - 2, Madhav Puram, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh – 250002, (“S.S. Enterprises”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) owns, operates, and manages Witch Racing Rush: Magic Speed (“Mobile Application”). Our Mobile Application is developed to offer users (“you” or “your”) an engaging gaming experience, including access to interactive gameplay, in-app features, premium content, virtual items, and optional subscription-based services made available through Google Play Billing.
This Policy (“Policy”) outlines the terms and conditions governing refund requests for purchases made within the Mobile Application. We are committed to conducting our operations in accordance with applicable consumer protection laws, platform-specific policies (including the Google Play Refund Policies), and best practices in digital content delivery. This Policy provides clarity on your eligibility for refunds, conditions under which refunds may be granted or denied, the procedures to request a refund, and the rights and responsibilities of both users and us as a game developer and owner.
This document is an electronic record and is governed by the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and rules framed thereunder, as well as any applicable amendments relating to electronic records. This electronic record is generated by a computer system and does not require any physical or digital signatures.
Our services are made available to users globally. By tapping “Accept”, you explicitly consent to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree with any portion of this Policy, you are advised not to proceed with any transaction through the Mobile Application. Please read this Policy carefully before making any purchase. If you have any questions, you may contact our designated support team using the details provided in this Policy.
1. Scope and Applicability
This Policy governs all digital transactions made within the Mobile Application through Google Play Billing, including but not limited to purchases of virtual currency, in-game items, content unlocks, consumables, premium upgrades, ad-removal features, and subscription-based services. Purchases made outside of Google Play Billing, including those facilitated by unauthorized third-party services or unofficial payment gateways, are not recognized or supported under this Policy and shall not be eligible for any form of refund or compensation.
2. Refund Eligibility and Timeframes
In accordance with Google Play’s refund framework, you may request a refund within 48 hours of completing an in-app purchase directly through the Google Play Store’s interface. During this initial window, Google will independently evaluate your request and, at its sole discretion, may process a refund automatically (if deemed eligible) without requiring any approval from us. Beyond this timeframe, refund requests are evaluated solely at our discretion and may be considered only under limited and objectively verifiable circumstances such as technical failure resulting in non-delivery of content, accidental duplicate transactions, unauthorized or fraudulent purchases (particularly by minors), or instances where a subscription renews despite timely cancellation due to system errors. Refunds will not be entertained for reasons such as dissatisfaction with game difficulty, regret of purchase, change of mind, consumption of the content, or random outcomes of disclosed features (e.g., loot boxes). All requests falling outside the permitted timeframe or failing to demonstrate exceptional circumstances will be respectfully declined.
3. Required Information for Refund Review
To facilitate an efficient and fair evaluation of any refund request, you must provide a valid Google Play Order ID, the email address linked to the purchasing Google Play account, the precise date and time of the transaction, the name of the purchased item or service, and a detailed explanation of the issue encountered. Where applicable, supporting materials such as screenshots or screen recordings should be submitted to substantiate claims related to non-receipt, malfunction, or technical errors. Requests lacking essential transaction data or failing to corroborate the basis for a refund will be considered incomplete and shall not be processed until all necessary information is received.
4. Evaluation and Processing Timelines
Once a complete and valid refund request is received within timeframe, we undertake to evaluate and respond to such requests within a period of three (3) business days. Where a refund is approved, the transaction will be reversed through Google Play, and the refunded amount will be credited back to the original payment method used during the purchase. The actual credit timeline may vary based on the payment method and your bank policies, but typically falls within a range of three (3) to ten (10) business days. We do not exercise control over banking institutions or card networks, and therefore shall not be responsible for any additional delays caused by third-party payment processors.
5. Subscriptions and Renewals
You may cancel any active subscription at any time through your Google Play account settings. Upon cancellation, the subscription shall remain active until the conclusion of the current billing period, after which access to subscription features shall be revoked. Refunds for subscriptions are not granted for unused portions of the subscription period except where required by applicable law or where the user can establish that no benefit was derived post-renewal due to system failure, billing errors, or inadvertent renewal without usage. Jurisdiction-specific laws requiring pro-rata refunds shall be duly honoured where applicable.
6. Unauthorized Transaction and Minor
We recognize that unauthorized purchases may occasionally occur, particularly in cases involving Minor (person under 18 years of age). If a purchase is found to have been made without the authorization of the payment method holder or by a Minor without verifiable parental consent, a refund may be considered, provided the request is made within seven (7) days from the transaction date and the purchased content remains unused. In such cases, we may require proof of relationship and identity of the authorized account holder. We strongly encourage parents/guardians to activate parental controls on Google Play to prevent unauthorized access to in-app purchasing functions.
7. Revocation and Refund Impact
Where a refund is granted, all associated digital goods, subscriptions, or benefits will be revoked from your account. This may result in removal of virtual currency, disabling of features, or loss of access to previously available content. In cases of excessive refund activity, abuse of the system, or refund requests involving already-consumed content, we reserve the right to limit future purchases, suspend accounts, or permanently restrict access to the Mobile Application to safeguard platform integrity and prevent misuse.
8. Compliance with Applicable Law
This Policy shall be interpreted in accordance with applicable consumer protection and e-commerce laws in all jurisdictions where the Mobile Application is distributed.
9. Contact and Support
If you are unable to process a refund through Google Play or require further assistance with your request, you may contact us by writing to contact@ternokass.com. Kindly include all required transaction details and allow us up to three (3) business days to respond to your inquiry. Please note that all refund evaluations are based on this Policy and applicable laws, and our decisions are final with respect to eligibility and quantum of refund.
10. Policy Updates and Final Statement
We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy at our sole discretion. Any changes shall be published within the Mobile Application and/or on our official website and will be effective immediately upon publication. Continued use of the Mobile Application following any such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
We remain committed to providing a fair and enjoyable user experience while ensuring the commercial viability of our digital offerings. This Policy is designed to balance user satisfaction with the practical realities of digital content delivery. We thank you for your trust and for being part of the Witch Racing Rush: Magic Speed community.
