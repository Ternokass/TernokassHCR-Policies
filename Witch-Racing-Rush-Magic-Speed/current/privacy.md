Our Mobile Application and its content are intended for users aged 18 years and above. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, you are not permitted to access, use, or provide any personal information through the Mobile Application. You must meet the minimum age requirement applicable in your jurisdiction.

Age Verification
We require all players to confirm they are at least 18 years of age before accessing the game.This age confirmation appears as the first screen when you launch the app, before any advertising, analytics, or other data processing occurs.
If you confirm that you are 18 years of age or older, we store a record of this confirmation in our secure Firebase database, including:
1.	Boolean Value – indicating that you confirmed being 18 years or older.

We do not collect your exact date of birth.
This record is stored together with your account information and is used solely to demonstrate compliance with applicable age-related laws and regulations.

All other gameplay-related data is stored locally on your device. And, where applicable, mobile application may have access to your microphone. In addition, certain technical information — such as IP address, device type and model, operating system version, app version, crash logs, interaction logs, and session duration — may be automatically collected by third-party service providers integrated into our app, including Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics (both by Google LLC). This information is used for app performance monitoring, crash reporting, and usage analytics. We do not directly store or access IP addresses or other such technical identifiers ourselves, except for the ones mentioned above; their collection and processing are handled by these third-party providers in accordance with their own privacy policies. All such data practices are also disclosed in the “Data Safety” section of our Google Play Store listing, in compliance with Google Play’s developer policies.

HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATA
Our approach to Personal Data collection involves a structured and comprehensive methodology. We utilize a range of formally established channels and mechanisms to ensure the lawful and ethical acquisition of Personal Data. These primary channels through which we gather Personal Data are designed to uphold the highest standards of data privacy and security while enhancing your experience on our Mobile Application.
i.	Personal Data You Provide: When you engage with our Mobile Application, you may voluntarily provide us with Personal Data. This includes data you share during registration, interactions, or transactions.
ii.	Automatic: Through the use of technology, we collect automatic information including Personal Data that reflects your interactions with our Mobile Application. This encompasses data related to your device information, interaction logs, gameplay data, and preferences.
iii.	Technology: Our Mobile Application may utilize technological means to collect data, including analytics tools, web beacons, software development kits (SDKs), and other tracking mechanisms. These technologies aid in analyzing your behavior, preferences, and interactions.
iv.	Third-Party Sources: We may receive Personal Data from third-party service providers and partners including social media platforms, payment gateways, analytics tools, and advertising networks who are involved in user authentication, transaction processing, or gameplay enhancement.


Firebase SDK (by Google LLC)
We use certain Firebase services provided by Google LLC to support the operation, security, and performance of our Mobile Application. These services are integrated using the official Firebase SDK for Unity and include:
1.	Firebase Authentication – to securely authenticate users via Anonymous Sign-In and generate a unique Firebase UID for consent tracking, legal compliance, and gameplay data storage.
2.	Firebase Firestore – to store minimal player information necessary for account operation, legal compliance, and consent record-keeping.
3.	Firebase Crashlytics – to monitor, log, and debug app crashes for stability improvements.
4.	Firebase Analytics – to collect aggregated, non-identifiable usage statistics for app performance measurement and feature improvement.
Purpose of Processing
The Firebase services are used solely to:
•	Securely create and maintain a unique player account via anonymous authentication.
•	Maintain required legal and consent records.
•	Diagnose and resolve technical issues.
•	Understand general user interaction trends (without identifying individual users).
Data Collected via Firebase SDK
Depending on the service used, the Firebase SDK may process:
•	Device Information – such as device model, operating system version, language, and timezone (used for analytics and crash reporting).
•	Application Interaction Data – such as app launches, screen views, and session duration (non-personal).
•	Crash Reports – including stack traces, error logs, and associated device information for debugging purposes.
•	Firebase Unique User Identifier (UID) – generated automatically during anonymous sign-in and stored in our database for as long as your account exists.
•	Authentication Tokens – used temporarily for identity verification and session management; not stored by us after verification.
All data transmitted to Firebase is encrypted in transit. The processing of this data is governed by [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).


Google AdMob & Ads Monetization (by Google LLC)
We integrate the Google AdMob SDK and Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK, provided by Google LLC, to display banner, interstitial, and rewarded advertisements within the Mobile Application. Ad formats may be personalized or non-personalized depending on user location, consent status, and applicable laws.
Purpose of Processing
These SDKs are used solely to:
I. Monetize the Mobile Application by serving ads.
II. Manage and record user consent for ad personalization where legally required.
III. Deliver personalized or non-personalized advertisements based on user preference and applicable regulations.
Data Processed by Google AdMob
In accordance with Google’s policies, AdMob may process:
I. Device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID)
II. Application usage data
III. Approximate location
IV. Advertisement interaction data (impressions, clicks)
V. Diagnostic and crash information
We do not collect or store this information directly. All ad-serving and related tracking data is collected and processed by Google LLC, acting as the data controller, in accordance with [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
Consent Record Stored by Us
For legal compliance purposes, we maintain a minimal consent record in our secure Firebase Firestore database for every player, including:
I. Whether the ads are personalized or non-personalized.
II. How consent was obtained (UMP form or manual consent panel).
III. The legal region basis for the decision (UMP-supported region or other).
IV. Date/time of consent.

This record is stored together with your account information and is used solely to demonstrate compliance with applicable advertising and privacy laws.
Consent & Legal Compliance
In regions where consent is legally required (e.g., the European Union, United Kingdom, California, India), we use the Google UMP SDK to present a consent form at first app launch. Users may choose between:
I. Personalized ads
II. Non-personalized ads
If the user dismisses the form without making a choice, non-personalized ads are displayed by default.
In other regions, personalized ads may be displayed by default unless the user opts out via in-app settings or Google’s Ads Settings page.
Managing Ad Preferences
Users can update their ad preferences at any time by:
I. Accessing the “Ad Preferences” section in the app settings to reopen the consent form (in UMP-supported regions) or disable personalized ads (in non-UMP regions) by Visiting Google Ads Settings to manage ad personalization directly in their Google account.


External Links to Legal Documents and Settings
Our game may display links to important legal documents, including but not limited to our Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, End User License Agreement (EULA), and Terms and Conditions. These documents are hosted on GitHub Pages or within GitHub repositories to ensure public accessibility and transparency.
